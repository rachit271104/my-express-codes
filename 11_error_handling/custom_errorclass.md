👌 Let’s use a restaurant analogy to understand it.🍴

🏠 The Restaurant

Customers (users) come in and make requests (API calls).

The kitchen staff (your route handlers/controllers) prepare the orders.

Sometimes things go wrong — wrong ingredients, out of stock, etc. (errors).



👨‍🍳 Custom Error Classes = Chefs writing error notes

Instead of just yelling “Something’s wrong!”, the chef writes a clear note:

❌ “Out of stock: cheese (status 404)”

❌ “Customer not allowed in VIP area (status 403)”

❌ “Order form incomplete (status 400)”

This is like throwing a custom error object with a proper message and statusCode.



🛎️ Middleware = The Manager at the counter

The manager doesn’t cook or create the error.
But he collects all error notes from the chefs and decides how to tell the customer:

“Sorry, the cheese pizza isn’t available today (404).”

“You don’t have access to that section (403).”

“Please fill in all required details (400).”

Or if it’s something unexpected: “We had a kitchen accident, please try again later (500).”

This is your central error-handling middleware.



✅ So:

Custom Error Classes = chefs making standardized error slips.

Error Middleware = manager who handles all slips and gives the right message to the customer.
